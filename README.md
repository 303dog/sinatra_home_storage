Welcome to the Home Storage Application. This is a school project created with the help of Sinatra and a Corneal gem.  After cloning into your local please make sure you are in the /homestorage file and run shotgun to render the application to your browser.

Using your email address and name, you will need to create an account to start logging and tracking all your things that you want stored in your personal "vault". This application will not allow you do anything unless an account is created.

Hopefully you find this app useful for keeping an updated list of your belongings. If you want to add new or more items remember to log-in and use the "new items" link to add to your "vault"

I dont anticipate any confusion with the operation of this application but if you do find any please feel free to leave notes.
